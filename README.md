Travel Journal Sensors – Milestone 2
My project demonstrates the use of the GPS and Accelerometer sensors in an Android application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. my goal of Milestone 2 is to read live sensor data and display it through a clean and simple user interface.

Features
	•	GPS Tracking
	•	Real-time Latitude, Longitude, and Accuracy
	•	Uses FusedLocationProviderClient for reliable updates
	•	Runtime permission handling included

 	 Motion Tracking (Accelerometer)
	 • Reads X, Y, and Z axis values
	• Calculates and displays movement strength
	• Sensor updates in real time

  Interface & Navigation
	•	Modern Jetpack Compose UI
	•	Simple navigation between Welcome, GPS, and Motion screens

Technologies Used
	•	Kotlin
	•	Jetpack Compose
	•	FusedLocationProviderClient (GPS)
	•	SensorManager (Accelerometer)
	•	Material 3

How to Run
	1.	Open the project in Android Studio
	2.	Run the app on an emulator or a physical device
	3.	Test GPS by using:Extended Controls → Location → Set location
	4.	Test Motion using:Extended Controls → Sensors → Accelerometer
